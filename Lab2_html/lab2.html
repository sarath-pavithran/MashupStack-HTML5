						<h2>Farmers in 3 States Suffer as Punjab Mandis Are Flooded by Produce from UP, Bihar</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Punjab's well-oiled mandi system provides an opportunity for traders and middlemen from other states, while farmers continue to struggle for the right price.</p>

						<p><b>Chandigarh:</b> Upinder Kumar Sharma, a farmer from Vaishali district in Bihar and also secretary of a local small farmers’ union, grew paddy over his one-acre farm. He told <em>The Wire</em> over the phone from his hometown that his produce was of fine quality.</p>
						<p>Upinder wishes to sell his produce at good rates, buy rice for his 
						<q>big joint family</q> and wheat seeds for the next season and have enough left to afford other household items.</p>
						<p>“You know what a local baniya told me? Your produce is fine but it can’t get you more than Rs 1,100 per quintal. I had no option but to sell it at his rate,” he said.</p>
						<p>The major problem for farmers of Bihar, said Upinder, is the lack of market opportunities. The Centre’s latest 
						<abbr title="Minimum Support Price">MSP</abbr> for paddy is Rs 1,868 per quintal but those like Upinder are forced to sell it to middlemen or agents at rates much below the government stipulated one. This is because government purchase is minimal and there is no check on state agencies when it comes to purchases, said Upinder.</p>
						<p>He said that even though paddy harvesting is about to draw to a close in his area, the process of government procurement that is done through panchayat level committees is yet to begin. <q>Even if they buy, farmers usually need to wait for three to four months for payment,</q> he said, which makes it open season for middlemen.<br>This is also the inter-state paddy racket that the Punjab police is claiming to have busted now.</p>
						<p>The Punjab government’s principal secretary for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, K.A.P. Sinha, told <em>The Wire</em> that in the past few weeks, police have registered 69 FIRs under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code for cases dealing with the influx of paddy to Punjab from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.</p>
						<p>Sixty of these FIRs have been registered in Patiala district that shares the border with Haryana, from which the National Highway 1 comes into the state.</p>
						<p>Inspector Gurmeet Singh, who is station house officer of the police station in Ghanaur block of Patiala district, said that farmers of other states are not involved in this racket. Most of the arrests in this case have been of drivers and their helpers.  “But this racket could not have been run without the involvement of traders, commission agents and millers from Punjab, UP and Bihar. Based on the transport documents, the police are trying to identify these people,” he said.</p>
